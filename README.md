## Details

This page was made with a minimalist aesthethic, using simple colors and going
as far as writing everything in a lowercase text style that I personally love,
it serves primarily as a portfolio to showcase stuff about me, where i've been
and where i'm heading, but also keeps some projects I had in mind for some time,
passion is the best motivation keeper!
